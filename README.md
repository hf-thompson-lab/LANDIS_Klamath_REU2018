# LANDIS_Klamath_REU2018
This repository should contain a working LANDIS-II simulation of the Klamath National Forest study area where PnET, Dynamic Fire and Fuels, and Land Use Plus run at 10 year time steps.

The purpose of this project was to show that the Land Use Plus extension for LANDIS can be used to simulate dynamic human response (which is preformed by the land-use-FireResponseToRun.R and FindFuelBreaks.R files) using LU+'s ablity to run external scripts/executables. I have also included some of the code used for analysis and graphing, as well as some of the code for extracting climate data from netcdf files.  

To run the LANDIS simulation, you have to install LANDIS-II and all other extensions mentioned above (and most likely some others that I will try to state later on). Once everything is installed, you can navigate to the Landis_Parameters folder in which the Runit.bat will start the simulation. I have include a .zip file of the Dynamic Fire and Fuels dll because I believe the new dll causes errors in what LANDIS expects for the fire parameter text files. If you are able to get LANDIS to run, you will notice that some of the output still prints to the parameter folder; I think that this is caused by hard coded paths for the some of the outputs in the verison of dynamic fire and fuels that I am using.
